# Layout Structuring

We adapt Post Process after layout detection to restructuring the title and content tree based on the layout detection result.

## Problem Statement

Using CV (Computer Vision) to classify titles and content directly is risky and often inaccurate because:
1. **Visual similarity**: Different elements may look similar but have different semantic meanings
2. **Context dependency**: The same visual element might be a title or content depending on context
3. **Style variation**: Documents have varying formatting styles that CV models may not generalize to
4. **Hierarchical complexity**: CV models struggle with understanding document hierarchy

## Strategy

### Phase 1: Layout Detection (Completed)
- **CV Detection**: Use computer vision models to detect layout elements (bounding boxes, rough classifications)
- **PDF Enrichment**: Enrich CV results with PyMuPDF text extraction and styling information
- **Output**: Layout elements with positions, text content, and basic type classification

### Phase 2: Intelligent Restructuring (Current Focus)
- **Style Analysis**: Analyze text styling (font size, weight, formatting) from PDF metadata
- **Position Analysis**: Use spatial relationships between elements to understand hierarchy
- **Content Analysis**: Apply NLP/LLM techniques to understand semantic structure
- **Hierarchy Reconstruction**: Build proper title-content tree based on multiple signals

### Phase 3: Post-Processing
- **Validation**: Ensure logical document structure
- **Content Merging**: Merge fragmented content pieces
- **Quality Assessment**: Validate final structure quality

## Implementation Approach

1. **Style-Based Classification**: Use PDF font/style metadata as primary signal
2. **Spatial Hierarchy Analysis**: Analyze element positions to infer document structure
3. **Content Semantic Analysis**: Use LLM to understand content relationships
4. **Multi-Signal Fusion**: Combine all signals for robust classification
5. **Iterative Refinement**: Allow manual corrections and learning from feedback

## Key Components

- `LayoutStructurer`: Main orchestrator class
- `StyleAnalyzer`: Analyzes PDF styling information
- `HierarchyBuilder`: Reconstructs document hierarchy
- `ContentMerger`: Merges fragmented elements
- `StructureValidator`: Validates final output quality

## Benefits

- **Higher Accuracy**: Multi-signal approach reduces CV classification errors
- **Better Hierarchy**: Proper understanding of document structure
- **Adaptability**: Can handle various document styles and formats
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and modular design
